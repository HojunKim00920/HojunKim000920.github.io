# Fixed-Wing Aircraft Design for National Aerobatic Competition

This project represents my first visceral encounter with the 'Gap' between an ideal model and messy reality. Growing up near an air force base, I was captivated by the flawless flight of fighter jets. This project was my attempt to recreate that perfection, and its challenges ultimately guided me toward the deep questions of control engineering.

### What: The Challenge
As the leader of a 4-member team in the Chung-Ang Aerospace Club, the challenge was to navigate the complete design-build-test lifecycle of a 1.6m wingspan fixed-wing aircraft. The goal was to compete in the Pusan National University President’s Cup, a national-level competition requiring both high-speed stability and low-speed maneuverability for aerobatic flight.

### How: Leading from Concept to Competition
My role was to direct the team, oversee system integration, and make critical design decisions based on rigorous analysis and hands-on fabrication.

* **Aerodynamic & Structural Design:** I performed aerodynamic and structural analyses using SolidWorks and AutoCAD to optimize the airframe. The core challenge was managing the trade-off between the conflicting demands of high-speed stability and the agility needed for aerobatic maneuvers.
* **Advanced Fabrication:** I managed the entire fabrication and assembly process, leveraging advanced manufacturing techniques including laser cutting and 3D printing. This allowed us to achieve a high-precision, lightweight aircraft that was robust enough for the competition.
* **Team Leadership:** I guided the team from initial sketches to the final flight test, ensuring our aircraft successfully executed all planned aerobatic maneuvers at the competition.

### Why: A Formative Success and a Deeper Question
This project was both a tangible success and a pivotal learning experience that shaped my academic ambitions.

* **Quantifiable Result:** Our team's efforts culminated in a **4th place finish** in the Fixed-Wing Scale Aircraft Division, a significant achievement in a national-level competition.
* **Lessons Learned:** When our meticulously designed aircraft faced unpredictable disturbances and deviated from its planned path, I viscerally experienced the gap between theory and practice. This moved me beyond hardware fabrication and ignited my passion for control engineering—the art of understanding and mastering the unseen forces that govern a system's behavior. This project taught me that the real engineering challenge lies not just in creating an ideal model, but in making that model robust to the chaotic reality of the physical world.
