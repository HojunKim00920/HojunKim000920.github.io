## About Me
I am Hojun Kim, originally from South Korea, and currently pursuing a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a Mathematics minor at Northeastern University (Class of 2026).  
After completing two years at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, I transferred to Northeastern to deepen my studies in dynamics, control, and robotics.  

My academic journey has been shaped by both discipline and curiosity: from leading a UAV team during my undergraduate years, to conducting self-initiated research on quadrotor aggressive trajectory tracking (QATT). These experiences have taught me the importance of robust autonomy in unpredictable environments.  

- **Education**: B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, Northeastern University | Class of 2026

## Professional Goals
My goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering, focusing on advanced control theories for autonomous systems. 
Beyond the Ph.D., I aspire to continue research in robotics and aerospace, contributing to safe and intelligent autonomous systems.
