## About Me
I am **Hojun Kim**, originally from South Korea, and currently pursuing a **B.S. in Mechanical Engineering** with a **Mathematics minor** at **Northeastern University**.  
Before transferring, I studied for two years at **Chung-Ang University in Seoul**, which gave me a strong foundation in dynamical systems and inspired me to pursue advanced studies in control and autonomous systems.  

My academic path has been shaped by both discipline and curiosity. While serving as a squad leader during military duty in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, I learned the importance of uncompromisable stability under unpredictable conditions. Later, as the leader of a university UAV team, I experienced firsthand the challenges of bridging theoretical models with real-world disturbances. These experiences motivated my undergraduate research on **Quadrotor Aggressive Trajectory Tracking (QATT)**, where I explored nonlinear control methods to achieve robust autonomy.  

Outside of engineering, I enjoy reading, running, and continuously learning across disciplines.
