# Projects

A showcase of my key research and engineering projects.

### 1. QATT: A New Control Paradigm for Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking
An independent research project where I explored the fundamental limitations of hybrid control architectures and proposed a new paradigm for uncertainty quantification by re-defining the command 'Gap' as a rich information signal.

### 2. Design & Fabrication of a 1.6m Fixed-Wing Aerobatic Aircraft
As the team leader of the Chung-Ang Aerospace Club, I directed a 4-member team through the complete design-build-test lifecycle of an RC aircraft, culminating in a 4th place finish at a national-level university competition.
