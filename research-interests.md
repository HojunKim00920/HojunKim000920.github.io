# Research Interests

My core research ambition is to develop control architectures that can provably guarantee safety and performance for autonomous systems operating in uncertain, dynamic environments. This ambition is built upon a foundation of several key areas in control theory.

### Robust Control
My fascination with robust control stems from a core belief that the true challenge in engineering is not creating a perfect model, but making a system resilient to the inevitable gap between model and reality. My work on the QATT project, particularly with Sliding Mode Control (SMC), was a practical exploration of designing controllers that maintain stability and performance despite significant uncertainties. I am keen to explore how these principles can be extended to create more adaptive and less conservative robust systems.

### Optimization & Optimal Control
While robustness ensures safety, optimization defines the upper limit of a system's performance. The elegant trade-offs between energy consumption, speed, and accuracy are central to designing truly intelligent systems. My future work aims to develop frameworks where robustness and optimality are not seen as conflicting objectives, but are co-optimized in real-time.

### Nonlinear Dynamics
The most interesting systems, from quadrotors to robotic manipulators, are inherently nonlinear. My studies in mechanical engineering and my hands-on project experiences have provided me with a strong intuition for nonlinear dynamics. I believe a deep understanding of a system's underlying dynamics is the essential first step before a sophisticated control law can be applied. My goal is to use this understanding to exploit, rather than merely compensate for, the nonlinearities of a system to achieve superior performance.
